    * to enable a provider, i.e. file, prowl, pushover, pushsafer
    set 'enabled' => 1, under selected provider
    * Prowl     : 'apikey' required
    * Pushover  : 'token' and 'user' required

### Twitter integration
----
If you want to use twitter, you will need to install two more Perl modules

*  requires Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1

    ```bash
    sudo cpan Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1

    # OR force install it
    sudo cpan -f Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1
    ```

*  requires Net::OAuth >= 0.28

    ```bash
    sudo cpan Net::OAuth

    # OR force install it
    sudo cpan -f Net::OAuth
    ```

#### Twitter setup

* create a new app @ https://dev.twitter.com/apps
* click "Create New App"
    * Name: unique name for for your app
    * Description: fill something in...
    * Website: you need some valid website..
    * (read) and accept terms
    * click "Create you Twitter Application"
* click "Modify app permission" under the Details Tab
    * change to Read and Write
    * update settings
* click the "API keys" tab
    * click "create my access token"
    * click "Test OAuth" button to view the required API keys need for config.pl
* Edit the config.pl
    * enable notification for twitter in config.pl
    * enter in the required keys, secrets and tokens


<br/>
### GNTP integration
----
If you want to use GNTP (growl), you will need to install a module

*  requires Growl::GNTP

    ```bash
    sudo cpan Growl::GNTP
    ```
    * Note: CPAN install failed on centos until I installed perl\(Data::UUID\)



<br/>
## Using the script


### Sending Notifications

* Follow the install guide above, and refer to step #5 and #6

* Sending test notifications:

    ```
    /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl --test_notify=start

#### Grouping of watched shows

```

* you can force a Daily backup with --backup

It will keep 2 x Daily , 4 x Weekly  and 4 x Monthly backups. You can modify the backup policy by adding the config lines below to your existing config.pl
```perl
$backup_opts = {
     'daily' => {
         'enabled' => 1,
         'keep' => 2,
     },
     'monthly' => {
         'enabled' => 1,
         'keep' => 4,
     },
     'weekly' => {
         'enabled' => 1,

       --backup       By default this script will automatically backup the SQlite db to: $data_dir/db_backups/ ( normally: /opt/plexWatch/db_backups/ )

                      * you can force a Daily backup with --backup

                      It will keep 2 x Daily , 4 x Weekly  and 4 x Monthly backups. You can modify the backup policy by adding the config lines below to your existin config.pl

                      $backup_opts = {
                              ’daily’ => {
                                  ’enabled’ => 1,
                                  ’keep’ => 2,
                              },
                              ’monthly’ => {
                                  ’enabled’ => 1,
                                  ’keep’ => 4,
                              },
                              ’weekly’ => {
                                  ’enabled’ => 1,
                                  ’keep’ => 4,
                              },
                          };

       --debug        This can be used. I have not fully set everything for debugging.. so it’s not very useful

## FAQ

* __How do I test notifications__
----

__Answer__

```
 Make sure you have enabled a provider in the config.pl

   ./plexWatch.pl --test_notify=start
   ./plexWatch.pl --test_notify=stop
   ./plexWatch.pl --test_notify=recent

```



* __I receive this error when running a test notification:__
----

```
Can't verify SSL peers without knowning which Certificate Authorities to trust

This problem can be fixed by either setting the PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE
envirionment variable or by installing the Mozilla::CA module.
```

__Answer__

```
sudo cpan
install LWP::UserAgent Mozilla::CA
```

__OSX__
* remove homebrew and macports. Force reinstalled modules, highly recommend installing Mozilla::CA prior to LWP::UserAgent



* __How do I setup a launchagent in OSX__
----

__Answer__

Create a LaunchAgent plist file, called com.rcork.plexwatch.plist. This should be saved in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

```
vim ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rcork.plexwatch.plist
```
Paste this text into the file, changing the /path/to/your/plexWatch variable, as appropriate. If you followed the directions above, this should be /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.rcork.plexwatch</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/usr/bin/perl</string>
		<string>/path/to/your/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl</string>
		<string>-notify</string>
		<string>-recently_added=movie,show</string>
	</array>
	<key>StartInterval</key>
	<integer>30</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
```

After you edit and save the file, you need to load the LaunchAgent:
```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rcork.plexwatch.plist
```


* __How do I install on OSX__
----

__Answer__

 : User contribution - Thanks rcork!

 Here are the steps to get it running on OSX. This was done with a clean install of OSX.
 * refer to the INSTALL section above for more details. This is a brief rundown.

1. Download plexWatch from github and unzip
2. Copy config.pl-dist to config.pl and modify for your notification options
3. Install XCode from Mac App Strore
4. Install XCode command line tools by launching XCode, going to preferences, downloads, Install Command Line Tools
    1. If this does not work, from Terminal, type "xcode-select --install"
    2. Software Update should now prompt you to install the Developer Tools. Install them.
5. Configure CPAN
    1. Launch Terminal.app
    2. Type "cpan" without the quotes and press enter
    3. If this is first time launching cpan, it will ask if you want to automatically configure. Hit Enter
        1. It will ask if you want to automatically pick download mirrors. Type No and hit enter
        2. Pick mirrors for your region. I've had the best luck with .edu mirrors
    4. Type "install CPAN" without the quotes and hit enter. This will update cpan to the latest version
    5. Type "reload cpan" without the quotes and hit enter.
    6. Type "exit" without the quotes and hit enter
    7. Install required perl modules from Terminal

    ```
    sudo cpan install Time::Duration
    sudo cpan install Time::ParseDate
    sudo cpan install Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1
    sudo cpan install Net::OAuth
    sudo cpan install Mozilla::CA
    sudo cpan install JSON
    ```
7. Now create data directory and set permission. Replace [user] with your username

     ```
     sudo mkdir /opt
     sudo mkdir /opt/plexWatch
     sudo chown [user]:staff /opt/plexWatch
     ```
8. Run plexWatch from Terminal. You shouldn't receive any errors or warnings
    ```
    ./plexWatch.pl
    ```

Idea, thanks to https://github.com/vwieczorek/plexMon. I initially had a really horrible script used to parse the log files...  http://IP:PORT/status/sessions is much more useful. This was whipped up in an hour or two.. I am sure it could use some more work.
