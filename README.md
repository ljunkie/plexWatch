### Install 

1) sudo wget -P /opt/plexWatch/ https://raw.github.com/ljunkie/plexWatch/master/plexWatch.pl

2) sudo chmod 755 /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl

3) sudo cp /opt/plexWatch/config.pl-dist /opt/plexWatch/config.pl 

3a) sudo nano /opt/plexWatch/config.pl 

Modify Variables as needed:
```
$server = 'localhost';   ## IP of PMS - or localhost
$port   = 32400;         ## port of PMS
$notify_started = 1;   ## notify when a stream is started (first play)
$notify_stopped = 1;   ## notify when a stream is stopped 

```

```
$notify = {...

* to enable a provider, i.e. file, prowl, pushover 
   set 'enabled' => 1, under selected provider

* Prowl     : 'apikey' required
* Pushover  : 'token' and 'user' required
* Growl     : 'script' required :: GrowlNotify from http://growl.info/downloads
* twitter   : 'consumer_key', 'consumer_secret', 'access_token', 'access_token_secret' required
* boxcar    : 'email' required
```

4) Install Perl requirements

* Debian/Ubuntu - apt-get

```
sudo apt-get install libwww-perl

sudo apt-get install libxml-simple-perl

sudo apt-get install libtime-duration-perl

sudo apt-get install libtime-modules-perl  

sudo apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl

sudo apt-get install perl-doc
```

* RHEL/Centos - yum

```
yum -y install perl\(LWP::UserAgent\) perl\(XML::Simple\) \
               perl\(DBI\) perl\(Time::Duration\)  perl\(Time::ParseDate\)
```


5) **run** the script manually to verify it works: /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl
  * start video(s)
  * /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl
  * stop video(s)
  * /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl


6) setup cron - /etc/crontab
```
* * * * * root cd /opt/plexWatch && /opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl
```

### Twitter integration 
If you want to use twitter, you will need to install two more Perl modules

*  requires Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1  
```
cpan Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1
```

*  requires Net::OAuth >= 0.28
```
cpan Net::OAuth
```


#### Twitter setup
* create a new app @ https://dev.twitter.com/apps
* make sure to set set ApplicationType to read/write
* enable notification for twitter in config.pl



### GNTP integration
If you want to use GNTP (growl), you will need to install a module

*  requires Growl::GNTP
```
cpan Growl::GNTP
```

* Note: CPAN install failed on centos until I installed perl\(Data::UUID\)



## Using the script


### Sending Notifications 

* Follow the install guide above, and refer to step #5 and #6

* Sending test notifications:

```
/opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl --test_notify=start

/opt/plexWatch/plexWatch.pl --test_notify=stop
```

### Getting a list of watched shows

* This will only work for shows this has already notified on.

```


Idea, thanks to https://github.com/vwieczorek/plexMon. I initially had a really horrible script used to parse the log files...  http://IP:PORT/status/sessions is much more useful. This was whipped up in an hour or two.. I am sure it could use some more work.
